# TUNSA Space Robotics' Project Submissions during NASA International Space Apps 2023
This is a repository containing projects we submitted during NASA Space Apps 2023. This year, we participated with 2 teams dubbed "Task Force 1" and "Task Force 2", each team solving one challenge.

**Task Force 1**
This team tackled the challenge: [Habitable Exoplanets: Creating Worlds Beyond Our Own](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2023/challenges/habitable-exoplanets-creating-worlds-beyond-our-own/) in which the goal is to use publicly available information on habitable worlds to design our own habitable world and write about what life might be like on it.

**Task Force 2**
This team tackled the challenge: [Managing Fire: Increasing Community-based Fire Management Opportunities](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2023/challenges/managing-fire-increasing-community-based-fire-management-opportunities/) in which the goal is to to develop solutions to address fire and natural resource monitoring through innovative use of technology and publicly available data, enabling local communities to report and monitor fires and/or improve current data distribution.
