# TUNSA Space Robotics' Project Submissions during NASA International Space Apps 2023
This repository contains 2 projects we submitted during our participation in NASA Space Apps 2023.

**Task Force 1**

This team tackled the challenge: [Habitable Exoplanets: Creating Worlds Beyond Our Own](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2023/challenges/habitable-exoplanets-creating-worlds-beyond-our-own/) in which the goal is to use publicly available information on habitable worlds to design our own habitable world and write about what life might be like on it.

# Firefly Guardian: An Autonomous Drone for Fire Verification and Monitoring

### NASA Space Apps 2023, TUNSA Space Robotics, Task Force 2

**Technologies:** SOLIDWORKS, Photovoltaics, Satellite Imagery, Aerodynamics, Flight Controller, Sensor Fusion, LoRa, CNN, YOLO, DeepSORT

## Introduction

"Firefly Guardian" is a groundbreaking project developed by the TUNSA Space Robotics Task Force 1 team for NASA Space Apps 2023. Our mission was to address the challenge of managing fires in remote areas by designing an autonomous drone capable of fire verification and monitoring. This innovative solution aims to enhance firefighting efficiency and minimize the risks associated with wildfires.

## Project Scope

The project spanned from October 1, 2023, to October 2, 2023. Led by Elyes Khechine, the Task Force 1 4-member team embarked on a journey to develop a sophisticated drone system equipped with state-of-the-art technologies to proactively detect and monitor fires in remote regions.
